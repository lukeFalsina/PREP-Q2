Evaluation of the parameter Delta in order to find out the optimal amount of rows, N

Test Condition:
Domain of the parameter delta = [0, 0.650000]
Number of samples considered = 10000
Interval between two adjacent delta samples = 0.000100


The minimum amount of rows is N = 13.458977 k obtained by taking delta = 0.140400
