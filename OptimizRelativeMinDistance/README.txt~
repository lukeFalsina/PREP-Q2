Evaluation of the optimal Delta to minimize N
Luca Falsina - StudentID 201301303

This simple program was developed with the intent of
helping to evaluate the best parameter Delta that
should be chosen to minimize the amount of rows, N,
of the random matrix M in the purpoused code

-------------------------------------------------------- 
INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------
This program is written in CUDA C and so it is necessary 
that the CUDA toolkit is correctly installed on your
machine. Assuming so follow these simple steps:

1. From the main folder enter the Debug directory:
   cd Debug/

2. Compile the whole project:
   make all

3. If everything worked fine, you should see the executable
   "OptimizRelativeMinDistance". Run it:
   ./OptimizRelativeMinDistance

----------------------------------------------------------
USE & RESULTS
----------------------------------------------------------
Please note that the analysis could be executed with values different from the default ones.
In particular 3 parameters could be provided when launching the program:
	1. Numbers of intervals tested for Delta [positive integer value] (Default = 1000)
	2. Maximum value tested for Delta [float value between 0 and 1] (Default = 1)
	3. Enable/Disable Verbose mode [provide a non-null string to enable this mode.. e.g. v] (Default = Disable)

The same information on the available parameters can be 
obtained by running the program without any parameter.

If you want to run the program in verbose mode with an 
high number of tested intervals, the advice is to redirect
the outcome of the application to an output text file.
e.g. ./OptimizRelativeMinDistance 1000000 1 verb > ResultFile.txt
